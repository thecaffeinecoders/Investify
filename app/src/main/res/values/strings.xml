    <string name="simply_put">Simply put, asset management firms manage funds for individuals and companies. They make well-timed investment decisions on behalf of their clients to grow their finances and portfolio. Working with a group of several investors, asset management firms are able to diversify their clientsâ€™ portfolios. This gives them access to higher value options with better capital appreciation prospects, as well as mitigating the associated risk. These pooled funds can be channelled into property, shares, bonds or other assets depending on the financial objectives of their clients. For example, the stock market can deliver fast returns, whereas property is ideal for long-term asset management.</string>
